```{r results='hide',echo=FALSE}
    url = "https://www.data.gov.my/data/en_US/dataset/labour-force-statistics-malaysia-1092/resource/535d70a3-2697-4007-b013-93fd6d33659e"
```

The shiny app analysis open data is obtained from the **data.gov.my** web site.  

This data set shows unemployment rate by state in Malaysia for year 1982 until 2019. The statistics is derived from Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is conducted every month using household approach and refers to those between the working age of 15-64 years old.  

Source of the data set is: `r url`  

The user of the shiny app can look at each of these data subsets graphically. For each topic, two graphs are available:  

* Column  
* Dot Plot
